# Changelog

## 0.6.0 - 2026-09-24

Official release. Changes since 0.5.1:

### Weather

- Add optional local-weather lighting for clear day, clear night, rain, cloud,
  partly cloudy day and night, snow, and thunderstorm. Each of the eight sky
  conditions has two selectable eight-second LED loops (16 total), including
  **Snow takes hold** as the fresh-install snow choice. Preview every loop
  without a city or network connection.
- Let Weather run on Home, in game, or everywhere. A permanent Weather scene
  and the permanent controller gauge are mutually exclusive; the controller
  gauge remains the fresh-install default until a user chooses a city and
  enables Weather. Countdowns, brief alerts, Valve's ownership guard, and the
  recording marker retain their priorities.
- Search for a city or postal code with an optional country, then request
  current conditions from Open-Meteo about every fifteen minutes. There is no
  automatic location detection or API key. A stale reading yields the LED bar
  instead of remaining on display. SteamOS HTTPS certificate verification
  remains enabled, with the system CA bundle used when Decky's embedded Python
  cannot find the issuer.
- Tune Weather-only brightness and the faint-LED cutoff for the physical
  diffuser. Final scenes avoid low-brightness brown, blue-grey and violet LED
  tails that looked unexpectedly red, cyan or pink on hardware. Temperature
  is deliberately not represented by LED colours.
- Add an independent, opt-in **experimental SteamOS top-bar** weather icon and
  temperature, selectable in Celsius or Fahrenheit. It hides unavailable or
  stale readings and removes itself when disabled. It has worked on one Steam
  Machine, but relies on a private Steam UI layout that may change.

### Settings and presentation

- Use the supplied configuration's global choices as fresh-install defaults,
  except that Snow takes hold is selected for snow. Existing saved settings
  remain unchanged. Personal per-game profiles from the supplied configuration
  are not distributed to other users.
- Add **Import configuration JSON** in Advanced / debug, with a file picker,
  validation, and confirmation before replacing global settings and per-game
  profiles. Invalid files leave the current settings untouched.
- Add a separate confirmed **Reset to defaults** action. Import and reset stop
  a running personal timer and temporary previews, but do not delete exported
  JSON or cached artwork.
- Add a Weather GIF captured from the interactive concept simulator, a real
  SteamOS top-bar photo, and an updated online simulator with all 16 weather
  loops. Artwork, Performance, Playtime, Light events and Controllers retain
  their existing behaviour.


## 0.6.0-beta.10 - LOCAL ONLY - 2026-09-23

- Keep fifteen Weather loops: two sun, two moon, two rain, two cloud, two partly cloudy day, two partly cloudy night, one snow and two storm. The original Sun/Moon through clouds loops remain, with a separate fade-out variant for each. Those new variants dim neutral-white cloud LEDs to black while the light appears, without dark brown or blue fringe colours. Rain gains the dimmer Pearl field and another blue accent per impact; snow uses paired and single melt-and-refill gaps; Pulse and echoes gains a second lightning phrase.
- Remove Weather temperature LEDs, thermometer, Celsius/Fahrenheit and threshold controls, Soft weather halos and Fixed colour test. Old saved values for removed settings are discarded on the next save. Retained Moon, Rain and Storm variant selections migrate when possible. Weather brightness and faint-LED cutoff remain available.
- Add an opt-in experimental SteamOS top-bar weather icon with the current temperature in °C. It works independently of the LED/weather or controller display, hides stale/unavailable readings, and removes itself when disabled or unloaded. Placement before the clock (or fallback icon row) uses an undocumented Steam UI structure and needs physical SteamOS testing. Temperature is fetched solely for this text indicator, never mapped onto LEDs.
- Tests and package validation are local only. No GitHub push or release.

## 0.6.0-beta.9 - LOCAL ONLY - 2026-09-23

- Replace the weather animation set with the latest approved mockup: two sun, five moon, four rain, two cloud, two snowy, five storm, and separate two-variant partly cloudy day/night loops. Use yellow/lemon sun rays, neutral silver/cloud/snow, blue rain, and white lightning instead of dim brown, blue-grey, or violet tails.
- Add separate night-time partly cloudy rendering for Open-Meteo code 2, including an ivory moon and two alternating clearings.
- Add temperature placement choices: one or two LEDs at both ends, one LED at either end, Off, or a brief thermometer after each uninterrupted eight-second weather loop. The thermometer fills across the 17 LEDs using the saved Cold-to-Hot range, then fades over 1.6 seconds.
- Keep existing temperature thresholds, colours, Celsius/Fahrenheit choice, brightness, faint-pixel cutoff, weather/controller exclusivity, and higher-priority signals. Migrate saved endpoint width to the equivalent new choice. Old out-of-range animation selections fall back to the first current variant.
- Update the Decky labels and saved-configuration summary. Local automated tests pass; physical colour and timing still require Steam Machine validation. No GitHub publication.

## 0.6.0-beta.8 - LOCAL ONLY - 2026-09-23

- Add Soft weather halos to all 35 animations, enabled by default and reversible for comparison with beta.7.
- Reduce colour casts in dim halos by subtracting excess RGB components, not adding white. Remove very faint tails wherever the animation moves instead of masking fixed LEDs at the ends of the bar.
- Never increase any RGB channel. Preserve bright accents exactly before brightness scaling, plus the independent temperature signature, fixed colour diagnostics and all other SignalBar modes. Weak details may dim or disappear; physical colour fidelity remains unverified.
- Show the selected halo treatment in Weather settings and the saved configuration summary. Retain existing brightness, cutoff, colours and temperature thresholds.
- Add all-variant/full-cycle checks for subtractive-only output and unchanged bright accents/temperature tips, plus persistence and raw-test isolation checks. No GitHub publication.

## 0.6.0-beta.7 - LOCAL ONLY - 2026-09-23

- Remove Weather's extra gamma curve for all 35 animations. At brightness 100% and cutoff 0, final RGB processing is now exactly neutral.
- Replace shadow remapping with an explicit faint-LED cutoff: pixels at or below the cutoff turn off; surviving pixels are not dimmed further. Existing brightness/cutoff values are preserved, but their effect changes and the bar may appear brighter than in beta.6. Higher cutoffs can make transitions more abrupt.
- Add fixed Light Events gold/white tests at 5%, 10%, 20%, 35%, 50%, 75% and 100%, on three centre LEDs or the full bar. Each lasts 12 seconds, shows the exact RGB requested and supports manual stop. Tests bypass weather brightness, cutoff and temperature tips without changing saved settings.
- Preserve countdown, alert and Steam ownership priorities. Steam's master brightness and the recording marker still apply; stop recording before comparing colours.
- Retain current animation geometry pending hardware observations. This build enables a controlled low-intensity/diffusion comparison; it does not claim a measured colour calibration or a confirmed physical fix.
- Include previous weather, temperature-unit and HTTPS fixes. No GitHub publication.

## 0.6.0-beta.6 - LOCAL ONLY - 2026-09-23

- Add adjustable Cold, Mild and Hot weather temperature anchors, with ordered bounds and persistent settings. Preserve the previous −10°C / 15°C / 40°C defaults.
- Add Celsius/Fahrenheit selection for weather readings, threshold controls, the quick panel and saved configuration summary. Store thresholds in Celsius internally so switching units never changes the LED colours.
- Keep colour blending between anchors and clamp to the Cold/Hot colour outside them. Performance temperature units are unchanged.
- Include the beta.5 colour fixes and beta.4 HTTPS fix. No GitHub publication.

## 0.6.0-beta.5 - LOCAL ONLY - 2026-09-23

- Rework sun and moon colours using the Light Events gold, champagne and white palette and its bounded RGB blending. Remove the brown sun background and saturated blue moon layers rather than merely dimming them. Keep the animation motion and breathing.
- Golden Swell now uses gold across its breathing halo; Silver Hush uses the same near-neutral white throughout its centre and outer halo. Blue Hour uses pale ice-white instead of deep blue.
- Add Off to the temperature endpoint selector so the animation can be viewed without the independent temperature colours. Existing one- or two-LED selections are preserved.
- Clarify that Weather brightness/shadow controls are not a measured hardware colour calibration. Light Events and the shared hardware writer are unchanged.
- Add full-cycle RGB regression checks, Light Events blend parity, and temperature-marker isolation/persistence tests. Physical colour fidelity still requires Steam Machine testing.
- Include beta.4's verified-system-CA fix for weather requests. No GitHub publication.

## 0.6.0-beta.4 - LOCAL ONLY - 2026-09-23

- Fix the weather city-search and forecast failure reported on SteamOS as `SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED` by retrying with the operating system's trusted CA bundle when Decky's embedded Python cannot find the issuer.
- Keep HTTPS certificate and hostname verification enabled; never fall back to an unverified connection.
- Add regression tests for a simulated missing-issuer failure and verify both city search and current weather through that recovery path locally. Real Steam Machine confirmation remains pending.

## 0.6.0-beta.3 - LOCAL ONLY - 2026-09-23

- Calibrate Weather RGB for the physical Steam Machine diffuser: dim midtones and fade dark brown/blue backgrounds toward black while keeping brighter animation accents.
- Add Weather-only LED brightness and shadow cutoff controls, plus direct night/daylight previews beside them. Other modes and Steam's master brightness are untouched.
- Keep the RGB preview aligned with the values actually written to the bar. The exact physical appearance still needs device testing.

## 0.6.0-beta.2 - LOCAL ONLY - 2026-09-23

- Add an optional country field to city search. Open-Meteo accepts a full country name or two-letter code after the city name.
- Return a clear backend diagnostic when city search fails, so a Decky/network error is distinguishable from an empty result.
- Exercise the real asynchronous Decky search entry point in automated tests and verify live city plus weather responses locally. Steam Machine networking still needs device validation.

## 0.6.0-beta.1 - LOCAL ONLY - 2026-09-23

- Add opt-in local weather using manual city search and Open-Meteo current conditions, with no automatic location detection or API key.
- Add five selectable LED loops each for clear day, moon and stars, rain, cloud, sunny intervals, snow, and storm, plus a one-cycle preview.
- Add a steady one- or two-LED temperature signature at both ends of the bar, with customizable cold, mild, and hot colours.
- Let weather appear on Home, in game, or everywhere. Permanent weather and the permanent controller battery gauge automatically turn one another off; the controller gauge remains the fresh-install default.
- Keep countdowns, brief alerts, Steam's LED ownership guard, and the recording marker above a permanent weather signal. Suspend stale weather instead of displaying it as current.
- Keep this beta local for device testing; stable v0.5.1 and GitHub are unchanged.

## 0.5.1 - 2026-09-23

Patch release focused on clearer documentation and a configuration export that
can be retrieved directly in SteamOS Desktop Mode.

- Streamline the README opening so the short product description and v0.5.1
  download lead directly into the main display modes.
- Rename the Advanced / debug summary to **Saved configuration** and add an
  explicit **Export configuration JSON** action.
- Write the export atomically to
  `/home/deck/Documents/SignalBar-configuration.json` on a standard SteamOS
  installation, show the exact resolved path in the panel, and keep the file
  owned by the desktop user even though Decky runs the backend as root.
- Group global settings, every saved per-game Display and Artwork profile, and
  the current game's resolved choices in the exported document. Controller
  device identifiers and runtime hardware diagnostics are not included.
- Refine the controller-battery README animation for a smaller download and a
  softer LED glow.

## 0.5.0 - 2026-09-23

Official release. Changes since 0.4.0:

### Controller battery signals

- Detect already-connected controllers from SteamUI's SteamInputManager service,
  listen for live connection and battery notifications, and recover with a
  background two-second poll. Disconnects clear stale device state.
- Keep live battery updates ahead of older controller-list snapshots, including
  after a list reorder or a late query. Unknown readings are not shown as zero
  or an invented exact percentage.
- Add an optional persistent battery gauge: Off, On Home, or Everywhere. Two
  controllers use mirrored eight-LED gauges, an unlit centre LED, and fixed
  white endpoints once the introductory animation has finished.
- Add brief connection and low-battery alerts, with independent Home/in-game
  visibility and a configurable low-battery threshold. Alerts are event-driven,
  not replayed on every poll; a controller present at startup does not create
  a false connection animation.
- Add one exclusive charging choice: Off, Brief, Continuous on Home, or
  Continuous everywhere. Continuous movement stops when charging stops or
  reaches 100%, with a short completion cue at full charge. Charging requires
  Steam to report both a usable battery level and a charging state.
- Offer three visual variants for connection, a single gauge, low battery,
  charging, and the two-controller introduction. Keep the charging half blue
  and its moving/endpoint highlights white in the two-controller display.
- Add four controller colour pickers and controller-only brightness. Previews
  show sample data and do not claim that a physical controller was detected.

### Display, sensors and interface

- Add a per-game Artwork or Performance display choice with Use default to
  remove the override. The global Disabled setting still overrides profiles.
- Collect CPU/GPU data independently of the active display, so Performance
  settings show fresh data without first switching to Performance. Clear
  failed or expired readings instead of leaving misleading stale values.
- Add a compact configuration snapshot in Advanced / debug for photographing
  saved choices across every tab, including global versus per-game Artwork.
  Keep device paths and controller identifiers out of this snapshot.
- Remove the duplicate live LED preview at the top of Light events; the
  previews beside individual animation controls remain.

### New-install defaults and documentation

- Set fresh installations to the approved configuration: Performance with
  mirrored CPU + GPU, Balanced response and Home display; classic temperature
  colours with 45°C/78°C thresholds; Library Hero/Auto Artwork; a white
  Steam Families countdown and 60-minute personal timer.
- Enable Light events with Return beacon notifications, Chromatic rebound
  achievements, Expanding echoes screenshots, and an isolated recording LED.
- Set the controller gauge and continuous charging to Home, brief alerts to
  Home + in game, Bright tip for a single gauge, Tidal fill for charging,
  Mirror greeting for two controllers, and 65% controller brightness.
- Existing stored preferences remain intact on upgrade. Refresh the README
  and capture a new controller GIF from the visual mockup.

Known limit: controller reporting uses private Steam interfaces and depends on
the controller and connection type; a full hardware compatibility list is not
yet available. Automated tests cover the integration paths, but cannot prove
every Steam Machine/controller combination.

## 0.5.0-beta.10 - LOCAL ONLY - 2026-09-23

Not published. Remove the duplicate live LED preview at the top of Light
events. Category-specific previews remain beside their animation controls.

## 0.5.0-beta.9 - LOCAL ONLY - 2026-09-23

Not published. Adds a photo-friendly configuration snapshot to Advanced / debug.

- Show the saved choices from Display, Artwork, Performance, Playtime, Light
  events, Controllers, and Advanced in one grouped, read-only summary.
- Distinguish global Artwork defaults from the current game's saved profile.
  Include inactive options so the summary can help choose future defaults.
- Keep device paths and controller identifiers out of this new summary; technical
  telemetry remains below it in the existing debug details.
- Add frontend coverage for the summary and backend coverage for the exposed
  global Artwork defaults.

## 0.5.0-beta.8 - LOCAL ONLY - 2026-09-23

Not published. Clarifies and separates controller charging behavior.

- Replace the overlapping charging switches with one exclusive choice: Off,
  Brief (about 3 seconds), Continuous on Home, or Continuous everywhere.
- Brief charging follows the brief-alert master switch and location. Continuous
  charging remains independent and stops if Steam stops reporting charge or
  reports 100%, when its short completion cue plays.
- Migrate previous beta settings to the closest new choice. Keep the legacy
  fields derived for compatibility with older local builds.
- Require a usable battery level before starting a brief charging cue.
- Audit the Controllers copy to distinguish measured battery data from sample
  previews, explain priority and startup limits, and show charging in the quick
  panel with its actual colours.
- Add tests for migration, exclusive behavior, duration and return to the base
  display. No GitHub push or release.

## 0.5.0-beta.7 - LOCAL ONLY - 2026-09-23

Not published. Fixes two-controller charging colours.

- Tint the charging controller's half of the mirrored gauge with the selected
  charging blue, while preserving white motion and endpoint cues. The other
  controller keeps its normal battery colour, and the centre LED stays off.
- Apply the same rule during the second-controller connection introduction, not
  just the continuous charging display. If both controllers charge, both halves
  use their own blue-and-white motion.
- Add regression tests for left, right, both, and all three charging styles.

## 0.5.0-beta.6 - LOCAL ONLY - 2026-09-23

Not published. Fixes the two-controller preview feedback from beta.5.

- Use white moving points, rather than blue and yellow, in Two signatures and
  Mirror greeting. Keep the fixed white battery endpoints for the completed
  introduction, with the centre LED off throughout.
- Extend the two-controller preview to six seconds so the settled white tips
  remain visible long enough to inspect. The persistent two-controller gauge
  keeps them visible after the preview when enabled.
- Add a regression test for left and right white motion, endpoint timing and
  the final hold.

## 0.5.0-beta.5 - LOCAL ONLY - 2026-09-23

Not published. Controller motion update based on the latest visual prototype.

- Add independent Off / On Home / Everywhere choices for a continuous charging
  animation. It stops at 100%, plays a brief completion cue, then restores the
  prior display. Charging can work without enabling the permanent gauge.
- Rework the three connection, low-battery, charging and two-controller visual
  styles to follow the motion prototype. Existing saved style IDs are retained.
- Make the two-controller gauge consistently mirrored. Keep the centre LED off;
  add white tips at the actual battery endpoints only after the intro finishes.
- Show charging movement on its own half when two controllers are connected.
- Add regression tests for intro timing, 96%/41% mirrored levels, continuous
  charging, 100% completion, and Home versus in-game visibility.
- No GitHub push or release for this local beta.

## 0.5.0-beta.4 - LOCAL ONLY - 2026-09-22

Not published. Includes fixes for the user's beta.3 hardware feedback.

- Fix a live controller battery reading being replaced one or two seconds later
  by an older controller-list snapshot. Live battery events are retained for
  the device connection, across polling and list order/index changes. Disconnect
  clears them, so a replacement controller does not inherit another's battery.
- Seed already-connected controllers from SteamUI's read-only controller state,
  matching by device identity. Once a live battery event arrives, it takes
  precedence over both list and UI snapshots.
- Add per-device diagnostics: list percentage, SteamUI percentage, latest battery
  event, chosen percentage, source and event age. No raw device serial is shown.
- Add colour pickers for healthy, medium, low and charging/connection colours.
  Add 10–100% controller-only brightness, default 65%, with saturated defaults
  to reduce the diffuser's pale white-green glow. Single/two-player gauges,
  controller animations and their previews share these settings.
- Collect CPU/GPU metrics every 0.5 seconds independently of Display and LED
  hardware availability. Artwork and Disabled no longer freeze sensor readings.
  Sensor failures clear old values; expired readings are not presented as live.
- Add per-game Display profiles: Use default, Artwork or Performance. Launching
  another game or returning Home resolves its own choice; global Disabled still
  overrides everything. Existing per-game artwork sampling is unchanged.
- Extend regression tests for the exact 96%/41% versus 96%/100% case, SteamUI
  startup readings, profile persistence/arbitration, colours and sensor lifecycle.

## 0.5.0-beta.3 - LOCAL ONLY - 2026-09-22

Not published. Real Steam Machine / Steam Controller validation is still required.

- Replace the obsolete SteamClient.Input controller-list/battery listeners with
  SteamUI's current SteamInputManager service. Discover it by its named service
  descriptor, not a hard-coded webpack module number.
- Query already-connected controllers at plugin startup, listen for roster,
  battery and disconnection notifications, and read the list every two seconds
  as a recovery mechanism. Resume requests a fresh reading.
- Read the actual controller_index, battery_level, is_charging and charging
  fields. Battery values 0 to 100 are percentages; missing/sentinel data stays
  unknown. No input/calibration feed or direct HID access is used.
- Preserve device identity when the index changes; do not carry battery values
  to another controller that reuses an index. Reject obsolete in-flight roster
  responses and retain newer battery events.
- Expose service connection state, hook count, query/event counters, response
  latency and error details. Distinguish an empty response from a failed read.
- Expire stale live data after ten seconds. Retry service discovery, missing
  hooks and backend delivery without opening the settings panel.
- Warn once if the initial reading is already low, and do not consume warnings
  while disabled, in the wrong context or blocked by a critical countdown.
- Fix the Tip gauge crash at zero/unknown charge. Update active animations from
  the latest reading and recognise unknown-to-charging transitions.
- Add lifecycle/race tests and an optional contract test loading the installed
  Steam generated service wrapper with a simulated transport. This validates
  the interface, not physical hardware compatibility.

## 0.5.0-beta.2 - withdrawn, unsuccessful - 2026-09-22

The attempted fix below did not restore detection on the user's Steam Machine.
Its release and remote tag were removed. These notes describe the attempt, not
a verified fix; beta.3 replaces this outdated callback path.

- Attempt to fix live controller telemetry on older SteamUI. Its battery callback sends
  levels as an ordered array matching the latest controller-list callback;
  beta.1 incorrectly expected an index/value pair and discarded the update.
- Read SteamUI's `ucBatteryLevel` percentage field when it is already present
  on a controller-list item.
- Preserve battery snapshots that arrive before the initial controller list and
  apply them as soon as that list establishes the correct ordering.
- Forward unchanged battery callbacks to Advanced / debug so the callback
  source and age can confirm that Steam is delivering telemetry.
- Stop registering the high-frequency controller-state callback. It is intended
  for live input/calibration data and is unnecessary for battery monitoring.

## 0.5.0-beta.1 - 2026-09-22

- Add experimental Steam controller battery signals: connection, low battery,
  charging, a permanent single-controller gauge, and a split two-controller
  gauge with the centre LED off.
- Offer three selectable visual styles for each of the five situations and
  immediate preview buttons that do not require a connected controller.
- Separate the permanent gauge (Off, On Home, Everywhere) from brief-alert
  locations (Off, On Home, In game, Home + in game). Alerts work even while the
  permanent gauge is off. Both categories preserve the selected base display
  after their signal ends.
- Detect controller-list, battery, and controller-state changes from Steam's
  frontend callbacks; serialize state updates to avoid stale asynchronous
  snapshots replacing newer readings.
- Warn once when a known battery crosses a configurable 5–30% threshold, or
  reaches Steam's lowest coarse level, and re-arm after charging. Never present
  a coarse battery level as a fabricated exact percentage.
- Keep Steam Families' final five minutes protected. Low-battery alerts have
  priority over ordinary short events, while native LED writes interrupt active
  animations. A permanent gauge never overrides a countdown or Disabled mode.
- Add a Controllers settings page, live logical preview, controller readout,
  callback-source diagnostic, new README section, and a captured
  controller-battery GIF.
- This is an opt-in beta for the permanent gauge. Steam's private controller
  callback payloads and controller-model compatibility still need physical
  Steam Machine testing.

## 0.4.0 - 2026-09-21

- Add opt-in Light events for Steam notifications, achievements, screenshots,
  and recording start/stop, with 14 selectable notification, achievement, and
  screenshot animations plus local previews beside every control.
- Detect every valid Steam notification type, use the achievement notification
  for unlock celebrations, watch for newly written screenshots, and track
  recording state through SteamClient callbacks.
- Let short event animations run outside games, interrupt them on a new native
  LED write, and restore the verified live display afterward.
- Protect the final five countdown minutes from transient events and preserve
  the existing Steam Families, personal timer, and selected base-display
  priority rules.
- Keep a pure red centre LED visible while recording over Artwork or
  Performance. Neighbour isolation is enabled by default to prevent diffuser
  bleed, and the marker never modifies a countdown or another event animation.
- Reorganize settings into dedicated Artwork, Performance, Playtime, Light
  events, and Advanced pages with a compact quick-access status panel.
- Remove duplicate Performance previews from the quick panel. Show CPU/GPU
  load and temperature with one logical preview, and only show the game image
  when Artwork is selected.
- Place the Artwork image and source label directly above its logical preview.
  Preserve the full Hero, Header, or Capsule aspect ratio without cropping.
- Draw a red horizontal guide over the Artwork image while adjusting a manual
  sample row.
- Prefer locally installed Steam custom-grid artwork, including SteamGridDB
  replacements, and support Hero, Header, or Capsule artwork for non-Steam
  shortcuts without requiring an API key or network request.
- Add an optional always-on Performance mode for the Steam home screen while
  retaining native LED ownership protection.
- Add Responsive, Balanced, and Smooth meter filtering, CPU/GPU/mixed layouts,
  selectable mixed fill direction, and shared physical diffuser compensation.
- Add custom Cool, Middle, and Hot performance colours through Decky's native
  colour picker alongside the three built-in temperature palettes.
- Show active Steam Families and personal countdown time with a live 17-LED
  preview at the top of the Playtime page.
- Change the default Extra dark LEDs calibration from three to two and replace
  the quick-access Wi-Fi-like icon with the stock Tabler `TbCubeSpark` icon.
- Replace the README with the new visual presentation and animated examples for
  Performance, Countdown, Notifications, Screenshots, Achievements, and
  Recording.

## 0.4.0-beta.4 — 2026-09-21

- Restore live CPU/GPU load and temperature readings in the quick Decky panel
  whenever Performance is the selected base display.
- Move an active Steam Families or personal countdown to a prominent live
  preview at the top of the Playtime page, including its remaining time.
- Put a local live LED preview beside every Light events preview control so
  animations remain visible even at the bottom of the settings page.
- Keep the recording marker as a pure red centre LED over Artwork or
  Performance, never over countdowns or transient event animations.
- Add an optional recording-marker isolation setting that turns the two
  neighbouring LEDs black to reduce optical colour bleed.

## 0.4.0-beta.3 — 2026-09-21

- Show the running game's artwork in the quick Decky panel, regardless of the
  selected LED display mode.
- Preserve the full image in Artwork settings and the quick panel, including
  wide headers and vertical capsules; neither preview crops the source image.
- Ignore late artwork responses from a previous game or image-source selection.
- Build and automated tests pass; the revised layout still needs a Steam
  Machine/Decky visual check.

## 0.4.0-beta.2 — 2026-09-21

- Add all 14 notification, achievement and screenshot variants from the two
  animation mockups, while retaining the three beta.1 patterns as choices.
- Save one animation selection per event category and keep queued events on
  the variant that was selected when they arrived.
- Make previews play immediately without enabling live events or changing the
  saved selection; recording previews do not change recording state.
- Split the Decky UI into a quick mode/status panel and dedicated Artwork,
  Performance, Playtime, Light events and Advanced settings pages.
- Keep the existing event priority, protected final five countdown minutes,
  native-write interruption and physical LED ownership safeguards.
- Automated tests cover each 17-LED variant and settings persistence; hardware
  behaviour still needs verification on an official Steam Machine.

## 0.4.0-beta.1 — 2026-09-21

- Signal every valid Steam notification type, including Community comments and
  types added later. Do not suppress later notifications because Steam reused a
  list index, and do not ignore real events during plugin startup.
- Add short, exclusive light signals for Steam notifications, unlocked
  achievements, newly written screenshots, and recording start/stop events.
- Make cyan notifications traverse all 17 LEDs; make achievements celebrate with
  three amber beats, a white-gold burst, an outward sweep and a full-bar glow.
- Temporarily suspend the base Artwork, Performance or playtime display while
  an animation plays, then restore its current frame without pausing its timer.
- Keep the final five minutes of every countdown protected: transient events
  are skipped instead of hiding the red warning or last-eight-second flashes.
- Keep the centre LED red while recording over Artwork or Performance, never
  over a countdown. Add an opt-in master switch, per-category switches and
  local preview buttons.
- Play light events outside games and let them briefly take over a stable
  Valve/system LED frame. Restore that exact frame afterward if still owned;
  cancel the animation if a new native write occurs. Disabled still wins.
- Sample active animations at 60 ms intervals (normal providers remain at
  100 ms) so the cyan crossing can reach the full 17-pixel span.
- Add animation, Steam-event mapping, priority and recording-state tests.
- Beta limitation: SteamClient event callbacks still need verification on the
  official Steam Machine; this build is not a stable release.

## 0.3.2-beta.1 — 2026-09-21

- Prefer artwork installed locally through Steam's custom grid (including
  SteamGridDB) over the unmodified Store image for the same game.
- Support custom Hero, Header and Capsule images for non-Steam shortcuts, with
  an available custom image as fallback when the selected role is missing.
- Read the active Steam account's custom grid when known, without showing
  another account's images; accept signed 32-bit shortcut AppIDs from SteamUI.
- Keep artwork discovery local and read-only; no SteamGridDB API key or network
  request is required.

## 0.3.1 — 2026-09-20

- Extend the existing **Extra dark LEDs** optical calibration to Performance
  as well as Playtime Countdown, retaining the default value of three.
- Keep Decky's Performance preview logical while writing the compensated LED
  count to hardware; e.g. 12 cells in the preview become 9 physical LEDs with
  compensation 3.
- Share one compensation across the two halves of the mixed CPU/GPU meter
  instead of subtracting it independently from each half. Each active half
  retains at least one physical LED. Artwork remains unchanged.
- Show the live logical-to-physical Performance mapping in Debug.
- Add Responsive, Balanced and Smooth meter-response profiles for CPU and GPU,
  with Balanced as the default.
- Filter the displayed percentage and LED length from the same value. Balanced
  limits movement over time, accepts sustained rises progressively, requires
  two lower samples before falling and then decays more slowly to prevent
  one-sample spikes from making the bar oscillate.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-09-20

- Start game detection, Artwork sampling, Performance activation, Steam
  Families observation, download ownership and suspend/resume handling as soon
  as Decky loads the plugin; opening SignalBar's settings is no longer required.

- Re-register Steam Families remaining-time observation when a game launches,
  keep parental time above personal timers and both base display modes, and
  hide parental time while no game is running.
- Cancel parental state immediately when its setting is disabled, the game is
  closed or another game starts, including during the final flash sequence.
- Clear stale running-game state on termination and resume from suspend instead
  of restoring Artwork from the last game.
- Move Playtime countdown below Performance in the Decky panel.
- Use constant pure red during the final five minutes and keep only the
  right-to-left circulation, avoiding two simultaneous animations.
- Repeat three brief full-white flashes during the final eight seconds of a
  countdown, then return immediately to the selected base provider at zero.
- Add optical dark-edge compensation for the Steam Machine's diffused light
  guide while retaining all 17 pixels at a full countdown.
- Make that physical compensation persistent and adjustable from 0–6 under
  Debug. The Decky preview retains the logical count: 12 shown with a value of
  3 writes 9 lit LEDs to the hardware. It applies only to countdown frames,
  never Artwork or Performance.
- Add a selectable countdown scale: start full, or map the full 17-pixel bar to
  1, 2, 3 or 4 hours. Longer remaining times stay full until that window.
- Move Debug to the bottom and replace raw monotonic values with useful ages,
  separate cooldown/stability timers, game detection source, backend sync time
  and Steam Families callback waiting/received latency.

- Added a temporary playtime countdown that automatically returns to the
  selected Artwork or Performance display when it ends.
- Added Steam Families remaining-time support through SteamUI's parental
  playtime callback, with an independent enable/disable setting.
- Added a free 5–240 minute personal timer that continues while the Decky
  panel is closed, plus a non-destructive 15-second preview.
- Added five starting colours, a shrinking right edge and a right-to-left
  travelling highlight. The signal turns amber below 15 minutes, then pure red
  below five minutes while circulation continues at constant brightness.
- Added deterministic provider, priority, direction, colour and persistence
  tests for the countdown feature.

## 0.2.1 — 2026-09-20

- Replaced Automatic with explicit Artwork, Performance and Disabled modes;
  existing Automatic settings migrate without losing their former priority.
- Added per-game Library Hero, Header or Capsule selection and replaced the
  technical cache filename in the panel with the running game's title.
- Added two mixed CPU/GPU fill layouts: both halves left-to-right, or mirrored
  from the outside edges toward the black centre separator.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-09-20

- Persisted Artwork row mode and manual position independently for every AppID;
  untouched games continue to use the global default.
- Corrected the official Steam Machine's physical LED direction while keeping
  software previews left-to-right, with a Debug override.
- Added CPU, GPU and mixed performance displays. Mixed is CPU 8 + black centre
  separator + GPU 8, with both halves growing inward.
- Added three temperature colour palettes and renamed the ambiguous Cool/Hot
  colour controls to Cool/Hot temperature with inline explanations.
- Made Automatic's Performance-over-Artwork priority explicit in the UI.
- Replaced the inaccessible native Debug details element with a focusable
  SteamOS toggle in the top Status section.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-09-20

- Added Valve-first Vanilla Guard with external-change detection, cooldown and
  stable-window recovery.
- Added the Providers → Arbiter → Renderer backend architecture.
- Added local Library Hero discovery, automatic/manual band selection,
  17-colour preview and persistent artwork cache.
- Added a GPU load/temperature meter using local DRM and AMDGPU hwmon data.
- Added compact Decky status, mode, artwork, performance and debug sections.
- Added fail-closed hardware handling, settings persistence, targeted tests and
  reproducible Decky ZIP packaging.
